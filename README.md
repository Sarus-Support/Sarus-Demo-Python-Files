This repository contains some Python/Jupyter files that demonstrate the functionality of the Sarus Monitor+ API.
The demos use some historic European Central bank rates to show some basic to advanced analytic reoport notebooks.
The reports are designed to demonstrate just what can be easily achieved with a few lines of Python code and are <b>not in ANY way</b> meant to be solutions. 
This repository is mainly used as a test bed to test for running the demos in Binder.
